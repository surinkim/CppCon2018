# Interactive Websites Using Boost.Beast WebSockets and Networking TS

This repository contains the presentation file and compiling
source code for my CppCon2018 talk.

## Description

The WebSocket protocol’s ability to enable full-duplex (two-way)
messaging between the browser and web servers is the foundation
which powers the interactive web. Boost.Beast implements the
WebSocket protocol using Boost.Asio which is itself a model of
the Networking Technical Specification: a blueprint of what
networking will look like when it reaches the C++ standard
library. This presentation introduces the Beast WebSockets
library interfaces and how to use them in programs. The talk
also introduces Networking TS concept requirements, how to read
them, and how to use them in applications which use Beast.

If you've ever wondered how GitHub can put the little blue dot
on the top right of the page when you get a notification, without
having to refresh the page, you will know after this talk.
